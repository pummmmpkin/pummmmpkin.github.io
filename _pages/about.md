I’m an undergraduate student at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

I work in the TEA Lab under the supervision of Prof. Huazhe Xu. Currently, I am serving as a student intern at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, where I am advised by Prof. David Held and Prof. Zackory Erickson.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and robotics. I focus on developing stronger and more efficient manipulation policies for robotic arms, enabling them to perform a wider range of tasks more effectively. I believe that the integration of large-scale datasets—especially extensive simulation data—with structured algorithmic architectures, such as combining high-level goal understanding via vision-language models (VLMs) with low-level action generation using diffusion policies, can significantly enhance the generality and capability of robotic manipulation. I look forward to seeing manipulation research transition more into industrial and daily life applications, providing practical convenience to people.
